# WIP React Giphy Search

This simple app fetches the trending GIFs after the component is mounted and
you can use the search bar to find your favourite images.

It uses [Giphy](https://giphy.com/), one of the best websites to find animated
images. The API is easy-to-use, you don't even need to generate a token.

It also uses flexbox and object-fit property which is not supported in IE at
all.
